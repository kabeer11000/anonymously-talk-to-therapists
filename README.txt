Ek Qadam Aur is a non-profit volunteering unit that was found in 2021. Students 
from numerous establishments from secondary colleges to universities are 
involved here in various drives and activities simply to bring a smile on the 
faces that cannot afford it. We at EQA aims to unfold happiness among 
youngsters, adults and elderly people with respect and consideration.

This repository contains the code for an anonymous chat service designed to 
support our efforts against postnatal depression. The platform enables 
individuals to communicate confidentially with Ek Qadam Aur therapists, reaching
areas where access to mental health professionals is limited. We are deeply 
grateful to our dedicated therapists who participate in this initiative, as well
as to everyone who supports us in any way.
